Log into your WordPress site using a smartphone... and no passwords! (almost)

== Description ==

With this plugin you can make passwords* a thing of the past. All you need is your trusty smartphone with a QR Code reading app.

*So you need to log in on your phone browser, but how often do you clear those browser cookies? At least when you’re visiting your Aunt Sally and remember that you need to post something ASAP, you won’t have to remember your password…

== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it

= Usage =

1. Scan QR code on login screen of your site.
2. Open link scanned in your mobile browser.
3. That's it! (If you don't have a cookie on your mobile browser recognizing you, the first time you try this you'll have to log in on your phone. After that you should be home free)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need to log in on my phone? =

You wouldn't want just ANYONE being able to access your site. Verification is still neccessary.

= So what's this plugin good for? =

Once you log in once, you won't have to again until your phone cookie runs out (every two weeks or so). That should save you SOME hassle.

= What about foo bar? =

I have no answer to foo bar dilemma.

== Screenshots ==
